    biography: `Albert Einstein (March 14, 1879 – April 18, 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential minds in human history. He revolutionized our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe with the Special and General Theories of Relativity, earning the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.

Beyond his scientific triumphs, Einstein was a profound humanist, passionate pacifist, and lover of music who found peace playing his violin, 'Lina'. Believing that "the most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious," he viewed life as an interconnected cosmic harmony.

In accordance with his explicit final will for absolute simplicity and spiritual communion with the cosmos, he requested no tombstone or monument. His ashes were peacefully scattered into the flowing waters of the Delaware River and the timeless woodland paths of the Princeton Mercer Sanctuary—dissolving back into the infinite nature he so deeply revered.`,

From Gallipoli to the War of Independence, and through comprehensive secular, educational, legal, and linguistic revolutions, he built a modern, sovereign, and forward-looking constitutional republic from the ashes of an empire.

With his enduring philosophy of "Peace at home, peace in the world," he became an inspiration for self-determination and human progress worldwide. His steadfast faith in reason, science, universal arts, and youth keeps his legacy timeless across generations.`,
