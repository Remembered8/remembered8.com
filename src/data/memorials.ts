    biography: `Ahmet Yilmaz was born on March 18, 1948, on the Black Sea coast of Trabzon. From his early youth, he was fascinated by the craftsmanship of aged stone, timber architecture, and peaceful urban sanctuaries where communities gathered in harmony.

After graduating from Istanbul Technical University Faculty of Architecture in 1968, he dedicated his career to cultural preservation and civic architecture. In 1974, he married the love of his life, Zeliha.

Throughout his lifetime, he designed civic libraries, children's botanic sanctuaries, and public squares. He frequently shared this guidance with younger architects: "Draw a building not merely for visual splendor, but for the serenity of the souls who will live and reflect within it."`,
